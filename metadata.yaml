description: Many of B. M. Bower's Western novels were adapted for the silver screen,
  an experience she puts to hilarious use in the entertaining novel The Phantom Herd.
  In it, Bower skewers the filmmaking process, depicting a bumbling crew of Hollywood
  moneygrubbers who come to the Wild West to shoot a movie, only to find that the
  truly untamed nature of the region is virtually impossible to capture on film.
